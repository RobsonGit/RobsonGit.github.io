Project summary - “Practical Machine Learning” course

1. After reading the pml-training.csv dataset into R and checking its basic features (number of observations and variables, categories in dependent variable) I decided to split the pml-training dataset into 2 subsets out of which one with 70% of observations will be used for training the model and the other (remaining observations) for testing the model. R commands that I used are provided below (I'm putting some results after '#' so that the summary is easier to read).


pml = read.csv("pml-training.csv")
dim(pml)
# 19622   160
table(pml$classe)
#    A    B    C    D    E 
# 5580 3797 3422 3216 3607
library(caret)
library(rpart)
set.seed(700)
inTrain = createDataPartition(pml$classe, p = 0.7)[[1]]
train = pml[inTrain,]
test = pml[-inTrain,]
dim(train)
# 13737   160
dim(test)
# 5885  160
summary(pml)
2. As the dependent variable classe includes 5 categories (A-E) I decided to use decision tree method as primary to build the model and choose the variables which are most important for prediction. The random forrest method was pointed during the course as the one that has certain advantages over other methods and often is the best method that wins in competitions so this will be the other method to check and compare vs. decision tree results.

3. # of observations in train dataset is quite big so no need to worry about small sample. summary(pml) revealed that many variables have a lot of missing observations. So the other assumption would be to build the model only based on those variables which include reliable data and not many missings. So next step in the process is to classify the variables to “missing” and “non-missing” based on % of missing observations.

4. Based on summary(pml) it is visible that 100 variables should be treated as “missing”. Also it can be easily checked that the information stored in these 100 variables is applicable only for cases where variable new_window=“yes”. So those 100 variables will not help much in explaining the behaviour of dependent variable, especially that in pml-testing.csv dataset we have only observations with new_window=“no”. cvtd_timestamp is a date/time variable so it would be good to convert it to other variables related directly to date or time and check if they help in anything. After creating new variables I’m splitting the dataset once again to train and test.


 DateConvert = as.Date(strptime(pml$cvtd_timestamp, "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M"))
pml$Weekday = weekdays(DateConvert)
pml$Month = months(DateConvert)
set.seed(700)
inTrain = createDataPartition(pml$classe, p = 0.7)[[1]]
train = pml[inTrain,]
test = pml[-inTrain,]
Using newly created 2 variables Weekday and Month and all 58 “non-missing” variables I build the first model, model1, using decision tree algorithm.


 model1 = rpart(classe ~ user_name + Weekday + Month + raw_timestamp_part_1 + raw_timestamp_part_2 + new_window + num_window + roll_belt + pitch_belt + yaw_belt + total_accel_belt +  gyros_belt_x + gyros_belt_y + gyros_belt_z + accel_belt_x + accel_belt_y + accel_belt_z + magnet_belt_x + magnet_belt_y + magnet_belt_z + roll_arm + pitch_arm + yaw_arm + total_accel_arm + gyros_arm_x + gyros_arm_y + gyros_arm_z + accel_arm_x + accel_arm_y + accel_arm_z + magnet_arm_x +  magnet_arm_y + magnet_arm_z + roll_dumbbell + pitch_dumbbell + yaw_dumbbell + total_accel_dumbbell + gyros_dumbbell_x + gyros_dumbbell_y +  gyros_dumbbell_z + accel_dumbbell_x + accel_dumbbell_y + accel_dumbbell_z + magnet_dumbbell_x + magnet_dumbbell_y + magnet_dumbbell_z + roll_forearm +  pitch_forearm + yaw_forearm + total_accel_forearm + gyros_forearm_x + gyros_forearm_y + gyros_forearm_z + accel_forearm_x + accel_forearm_y + accel_forearm_z + magnet_forearm_x + magnet_forearm_y + magnet_forearm_z, data=train, method="class")
model1 has the accuracy at about 0.82 for both train and test datasets so this would be the expected out-of sample error for this model.

5. Given the fact that testing set pml-testing.csv (file with 20 observations to predict) does not include observations with new_window=“yes” I check what happens if the observations with new_window=”yes” are removed from training dataset.


 pml_subset = subset(pml, new_window=="no")
set.seed(700)
inTrain2 = createDataPartition(pml_subset$classe, p = 0.7)[[1]]
train2 = pml_subset[inTrain2,]
test2 = pml_subset [-inTrain2,]
dim(train2)
# 13453   162
dim(test2)
# 5763  162

model2 = rpart(classe ~ user_name + Weekday + Month + raw_timestamp_part_1 + raw_timestamp_part_2 + new_window + num_window + roll_belt + pitch_belt + yaw_belt + total_accel_belt +  gyros_belt_x + gyros_belt_y + gyros_belt_z + accel_belt_x + accel_belt_y + accel_belt_z + magnet_belt_x + magnet_belt_y + magnet_belt_z + roll_arm + pitch_arm + yaw_arm + total_accel_arm + gyros_arm_x + gyros_arm_y + gyros_arm_z + accel_arm_x + accel_arm_y + accel_arm_z + magnet_arm_x +  magnet_arm_y + magnet_arm_z + roll_dumbbell + pitch_dumbbell + yaw_dumbbell + total_accel_dumbbell + gyros_dumbbell_x + gyros_dumbbell_y +  gyros_dumbbell_z + accel_dumbbell_x + accel_dumbbell_y + accel_dumbbell_z + magnet_dumbbell_x + magnet_dumbbell_y + magnet_dumbbell_z + roll_forearm +  pitch_forearm + yaw_forearm + total_accel_forearm + gyros_forearm_x + gyros_forearm_y + gyros_forearm_z + accel_forearm_x + accel_forearm_y + accel_forearm_z + magnet_forearm_x + magnet_forearm_y + magnet_forearm_z, data=train2, method="class")
From accuracy results it looks like excluding observations with new_window=“yes” does not change much and both models do not differ significantly (accuracy in both models is high and similar at around 0.82-0.83). This is confirmed also by model1$variable.importance and model2$variable.importance or “Variable importance” part from summary(model1) and summary(model2) which show that generally variables chosen by both decision tree models are the same and they differ only slightly on importance.

6. So now let’s try random forest. I use randomForest library directly as 'train' function from caret library somehow is much slower on my computer.


 library(randomForest)
I take only most important variables pointed by decision tree models so now I deal with only first 10 variables pointed in “Variable importance” part above.


 set.seed(700)
model3 = randomForest(as.factor(classe) ~ raw_timestamp_part_1 + roll_belt + num_window + user_name + magnet_dumbbell_z + pitch_belt + pitch_forearm + accel_dumbbell_y + accel_belt_z + total_accel_dumbbell, data=train2)
The accuracy results (around 0.99-1 on both train and test dataset) show that the Random Forest model works much better than decision tree and we can expect that this model has really very low out-of-sample error!

7. Given so good accuracy of Random Forest model I check if it still works fine if I limit # of variables (simpler model has a chance to work better on new sample).


 model3$importance

## roll_belt                      1328.0
## num_window                     2101.7
## user_name                       376.5

## pitch_forearm                   841.8
## accel_dumbbell_y                550.6
## accel_belt_z                    556.6
## total_accel_dumbbell            324.3
Here I’ve made another several attempts to check if the model will still work well:

a/ with 3 most important variables,

b/ with 3 most important + user_name added (as the behaviour may depend on person)

c/ with 4 most important variables.

Also done a check with decision tree (simplifying the tree model to 3 most important variables helps quite significantly here, leading to improvement of accuracy from about 0.82 to 0.90) and different split to train/test datasets based on different set.seed (Random Forest model still gives accuracy close to 1). Below results presented for model from point a.

Based on these results we can say that the expected out-of sample error should be close to 0.

8. So the last step is just to apply model4 on pml-testing.csv dataset.

 pml_test = read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
predRF = predict(model4, newdata=pml_test, type="class")
predRF
